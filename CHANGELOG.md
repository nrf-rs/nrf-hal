## [0.12.0]

### New Features

- Derive more traits for `gpio::{Level, Port}` ([#185]).
- COMP module ([#189]).
- QDEC module ([#188]).
- LPCOMP module ([#195]).
- TWIS module ([#196] [#230]).
- PWM module ([#200] [#231]).
- I2S module ([#201] [#209] [#225] [#237]).
- SPIS module ([#226] [#236]).
- Add support for the nRF52811 ([#227]).
- Add PPI channel group tasks ([#212]).
- Add PPI endpoints for timers ([#239]).
- Allow disabling and reenabling the TWIM instance ([#266]).

### Enhancements

- Improve SAADC docs ([#218]).
- Update Embed.toml of all examples to new defaults ([#229]).
- Make `ConfigurablePpi` and subtrait of `Ppi` ([#244]).

### Fixes

- Refuse to build nRF52+ HALs for thumbv6m targets ([#203]).
- Refuse to build `nrf52810-hal` for hard-float targets, and `nrf51-hal` for thumbv7+ targets
  ([#206]).
- Set the correct Port in GPIOTE ([#217] [#248]).
- Correct TWIM port initialization for P1 pins ([#221]).
- Fix race condition in RTC event handling ([#243]).

### Breaking Changes

- Remove `Spi::read` in favor of `transfer_split_uneven` ([#190]).
- Make GPIOs start in a `Disconnected` state instead of `Input<Floating>` ([#220] [#245]).
- Seal¹ the `timer::Instance` trait ([#214]).
- Seal¹ all `Instance` traits ([#255]).
- Seal¹ PPI traits ([#259]).
- Various TWIM fixes and improvements - removes automatic transfer splitting ([#242]).
- Remove typestate from RTC to make it easier to use ([#252]).
- Also return owned `Pins` from `Usart::free()` ([#261]).

¹ _A trait can be sealed by making a private trait a supertrait. That way, no
downstream crates can implement it (since they can't name the supertrait).
This is just to make sure the trait isn't implemented by types that shouldn't
implement it._

### Internal Improvements

- Utilize [`cargo-xtask`] to simplify CI and the release process ([#207] [#210]).
- Add `conf()` utility function to reduce code duplication in GPIO ([#250]).
