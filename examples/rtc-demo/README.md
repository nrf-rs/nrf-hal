# RTC demo

This example shows how to use the compare functionality of the real-time counter peripheral.
Runs on the nRF52840_DK but can easily be adapted for other hardware.

## Set up with `cargo-embed`

Install `cargo-embed` if you don't have it already:

```console
$ cargo install cargo-embed
```

Then just `cd` to the example folder and run

```console
$ cargo embed --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```
